Therefore, this article presents an exploration of research works, prior to another main one: Quality model centered on learning for social and ubiquitous learning environments. The objective is to obtain theoretical components that allow to adequately guide the way in which learning should be acquired. From the methodology, the verification technique is established in different topics and, on the other hand, the study of theories and learning regarding three approaches as supports for future research: instructional design, connected environments and mobile technologies. It can be concluded that this work will allow exploring connected, ubiquitous and quality-focused learning models. In the same way, it will serve as a guide to determine which other factors could have greater incidence and depth in terms of analysis in upcoming and future investigations.

The main objective is to gain access to the representations and theoretical and practical knowledge about the teaching of oral skills of teachers at this stage through the analysis of the argumentative discourse they display when giving an account of their decisions and actions. The instrument used was a semi-structured clinical interview, on which two types of study were carried out: one focused on the systematisation of the categories and meta-categories present in the content of the statements, and the other looked in depth at the discursive mechanisms employed. The results highlight the fact that these teachers believe that their training is not sufficient for a more complete teaching of oral skills and that the work done on these skills in pre-school education is lost in primary education due to a lack of coordination. The conclusions point to the need to improve the training of these teachers in relation to the epistemology of oral competence and its didactics, as well as to promote more research to guide innovation in this area. © 2023 Universidad de Murcia.

Such complex competencies like critical and creative thinking is a topic that are becoming more and more relevant. In the past, researchers have shown a direct link between creative thinking and teaching methods. The project will apply a STEM research method throughout the study and comparing SSCS learning. The study focuses on the critical examination of specific assignments and students' critical and creative thinking. In this study, researchers used prisms and pyramids as stimuli for 125 students to evaluate their imagination. This study uses a quasi-experimental design to explore a different hypothesis about the link between STEM and SSCS on student creativity and critical thinking. To determine whether or not the data collection technique can assist students in improving their critical and creative thinking, it has been put through its paces. MANOVA has been shown to be effective in testing hypotheses in several studies. Compared to the SSCS learning model, the STEM-based K-13 curriculum positively impacts critical and creative thinking. It can be concluded that the STEM approach, as opposed to the SSCS model, can be used as an alternative solution for learning in the industrial era 4.0. © 2022 Universidad de Murcia.

The data collection instruments used were an observation sheet of indicators of curricular management, and a rubric to evaluate the teaching digital competence. The results show that there are at the curricular level, objectives and subjects that guide pedagogical training in the educational use of digital technology. However, in the assessment of TDC in students, they are located at the lowest levels of the rubric, with 37.3% at the Lower level, and 30.7% at the Low level.

Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs) have prevailed over face-to-face settings, with technology-mediated education taking on a leading role and giving rise to new forms of knowledge construction and interaction among educational stakeholders. Although new opportunities for interaction exist, the low student participation in VLEs has motivated research aimed to identify alternatives to increase collaboration in e-learning platforms. This article presents the results of a research oriented to how to foster or enhance communicative interactions and collaboration mediated by ICTs in VLEs. The research was conducted using a qualitative perspective with a hermeneutic methodological approach. For this survey, 124 primary studies and 42 VLEs from the Academic UVirtual platform of the University of Medellín, Colombia, were systematized. As part of the results, the following factors were identified: didactic, mediation, technological, and motivation-feedback, which can facilitate communication and collaboration. Such factors also facilitate: (1) the characterization of communicative interactions to promote collaboration; (2) the definition of actions aimed at fostering critical thinking and self-learning skills, and continuous/flexible teacher-student development; and (3) the implementation of enriched VLEs using online tools. © 2023 Universidad de Murcia.

Such an objective is proposed with the intention of building democratic societies, which is in turn a complex and difficult goal to concretise in teaching programmes. In this sense, in-depth reading, argumentative skills and information competency are often identified as necessary skills that require the coexistence of printed and digital formats, according to various studies. Within this framework, the non-fiction picturebook aimed at children favours these skills due to its characteristics, as can be concluded from this study. Thus, based on the review of the catalogues of 61 publishers and the analysis of 250 non-fictional works, the keys to the construction of these books are presented through the selection of a representative corpus that is provided as a proposed reading programme in Primary Education.

Using a descriptive and inferential cross-sectional design, this study analyzes the digital competence level with which teachers transitioned to emergency remote teaching during confinement and explores digital training’s impact on the proficiency of such competence and identifies the digital teacher profiles. For this purpose, a questionnaire was applied to a sample of 220 teachers from a Spanish public university. The main findings reveal an intermediate level of digital competence with fluctuations among the competency areas. It was found that previous digital training seems to have been a necessary but not sufficient condition for optimal migration. Finally, five digital profiles are detected: objectors, laggards, confident, learners and avant-gardists. It concludes with the need to establish training plans based on a digital competency diagnosis, the implementation of technological tools in teaching, and the use of innovative pedagogical and methodological approaches. It is recommended to further expand the research by incorporating other variables to validate these preliminary findings. © 2023 Universidad de Murcia.

We also examine the relation of this belief with other relevant factors such as parent education, gender, attitude, and academic performance. Two hundred seventy-six students from mathematics education and primary teacher education participated in this study (15 % male and 85% female, mean age = 20.65). A quantitative approach was used in the present study. The finding of this study suggested that certainty of knowledge and attainability of the truth are more specific domains. Mathematics education students hold stronger beliefs about the certainty of knowledge than primary teacher education students, the principle in mathematics is unchanging, and most of the truth in mathematics is already found. In contrast, the beliefs about the justification for knowing and the source of knowledge are more general domains. We found mathematics education students and primary teacher education are equal in their beliefs about the justification for knowing and the source of knowledge. The influence of these beliefs on academic performance is significant. In both field studies, personal epistemological beliefs correlate with attitudes toward academic performance. Both Male and female students in the mathematics education and primary teacher education department are equal in personal epistemological beliefs.

They are also useful to people in their professional and personal lives, as a way of organizing the resolution of their problems, and of representing the reality that surrounds them. In a more elaborate scheme, this complex of skills constitutes a new literacy - or the most substantial part of it - and an inculturation to deal with a new culture: Digital culture in the knowledge society. We have seen how Bayesian Probability is used in epidemiology models to determine models of data evolution on contagion and deaths in COVID. We have also seen it in natural language processing. We could also see it in many cases in the most varied scientific and process analysis fields. In this way, with the automation of Bayesian methods and the use of probabilistic graphical models, it is possible to identify patterns and anomalies in voluminous data sets in fields. Fields as diverse as linguistic corpus, astronomical maps, adding functionalities to the practice of magnetic resonance imaging, or to the habits of buying with cards, online or smartphones. In this new way of proceeding, big data analysis and Bayesian theory are associated. If we consider that Bayesian thinking (this way of proceeding) as one more element of computational thinking, then, to what has been said on previous occasions, we must now add the idea of generalized computational thinking, which goes beyond education It is no longer about aspects purely associated with professional or vital practice to deal with life and the world of work, but as a preparation for basic research and for a research methodology in almost all disciplines. Thus defined, computational thinking is influencing research in almost all areas, both in the sciences and the humanities. An instruction focused on this component of computational thinking, or including it, at an early stage, in Secondary, would allow to activate these learnings as very valuable and very complex components at a later stage.

Specifically, it studies whether it is possible to improve the development of mathematical competence through programming activities in 5th grade of Primary Education. The research design are based on the lessons learned from the ScratchMaths project developed by University College London in the United Kingdom. Two groups of non-equivalent students have been used, the experimental group and the control group, without random assignment, with pre-test and post-test measurement on the mathematical competence variable. More than 3,700 students participated in the investigation. The results show that the students in the experimental group developed this competence to a greater extent than the students in the control group, with a significant and positive impact. Being the intervention effect size d=0.449, it can be stated that the project achieved the intended effect on mathematical competence. The generalization of computational thinking experiences in the curriculum can guarantee the improvement of the quality of the educational processes. © 2021 Universidad de Murcia.

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to better understand the impact of educational emergency situation on the pedagogical practices of university teachers, analyzing the areas of resistance to the implementation of digital environments to teaching. Methodology/Approach: The research followed a mixed methods approach, combining qualitative and quantitative components. It places special emphasis on the qualitative components of the research. Results/Conclusions: The study identified two dimensions in the disposition to genuine pedagogical change in university teachers: One is their level of digital literacy before the crisis; the second is his pedagogical conception of teaching. In this work the model of acceptance of technologies developed by Venkatesh and colleagues (UTAUT Model) is analyzed, and is enriched with a typology of acceptance of pedagogical change (TACP) that allows the researchers to understand the situation and act accordingly. Implications: This model can be applied to different crisis situations and can be useful for the training and development of university teachers in the field of digital literacy, taking into account the limitations indicated at the end of the work. © 2021 Universidad de Murcia.

Moreover, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the technological advancements, learning environments are being transformed. Metaverse is a computer-generated lifelike 3D virtual extension of the physical world as it immerses users, allows them to interact with others and with digital objects, and eliminates the constraints of distance and time differences. It is characterized by persistence, interactivity, and embodiment. The use of the metaverse in educational and training processes to create new learning environments that allow learners to function in a parallel, safe and personalized reality is gaining ground. The aim of this study is to analyze the existing research into the metaverse in the educational field. Hence, a systematic literature review has been carried out using the Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus databases. To provide more complete and constructive results, no year, educational level, or subject restrictions were set. As metaverse is a new topic and taking the inclusion and exclusion criteria into account, a total of 17 articles has been analyzed. Based on the findings, metaverse has the potential to enrich and transform education and lead to increased learning outcomes and enhanced students' engagement and motivation. Despite this fact, the use of metaverse in education is in its infancy, thus, more research and experiments should be carried out in all educational levels and populations to assess its impact and improve its effectiveness. Finally, the need for designing valid instruments to evaluate the educational experiences generated within the metaverse was evident. © 2023 Universidad de Murcia.

From this perspective, several studies have been carried out with the aim of defining the most influential variables and/or factors in the adoption, use and integration of TD from the teacher's perspective, of which very few conclude with a clear definition. From this point of view, the study aims to design an explanatory theoretical instructional model of the different teacher profiles that brings together all the variables and factors that can intervene in the integration of digital technologies in the educational environment, focusing on the needs, types and characteristics of teachers. Based on the analysis of the literature and previous pragmatic studies, different variables have been identified that influence the integration of TD and that have allowed the design of a model of teacher profiles from the perspective of teaching practice, which determine the stages of adoption, applying contextual paradigms. The study concludes that the determining variables for the appropriation of TD from the context of teachers are Attitude and Self-efficacy, to which are added the factors: Usefulness of use, Ownership, access to TD, Teacher training, Ease of use, Importance, social pressure and Interest in TDs. These variables and factors lead to the creation of an instructional model of theoretical and explanatory approximation of the five teacher profiles with respect to the adoption, use and integration of TD in the educational process, which we have labelled as: ""resistant"", ""confused"", ""adopter"", ""persuaded"" and ""innovator"". © 2022 Universidad de Murcia.

A case study was carried out and information on the process was collected through questionnaires, interviews, analysis of interactions in forums, wikis, metacognition essays and final application papers. The analysis was organized on the basis of two dimensions: group cognitive and individual cognitive. From the results obtained, it is highlighted that group work allowed a collaborative construction of convergence towards the common goal of solving the problem posed. Although dialogic interactions tending to build knowledge in a collaborative way were identified, some groups still had summative or individual ways of facing the task. In terms of knowledge construction, the proposed work broadened the perspective of analysis of the socio-scientific question posed, fostered the interpretation of scientific information, the evaluation of different sources of information, the analysis of evidence and the construction of arguments. © 2022 Universidad de Murcia.

In this article, the objective is to explore the transition from face-to-face education to virtual mode, as well as its implications for pedagogical and public proposals in the post-pandemic era. The findings suggest that the Mexican basic education system has undergone three stages of transformation in the face of the pandemic. However, we also note that there are several shortcomings in the Learning at Home project, mainly linked to the lack of guarantee of educational equity and efficiency. We conclude that in order to address the challenges in basic education not only in Mexico, but also in the Latin American region as a whole, a revolutionary vision towards a comprehensive approach is needed, taking into account the diversity of socio-economic conditions. © 2021 Universidad de Murcia.

In the educational materials used in these resources, the Microcontent (MC) format predominates, with its fragmented and small information units. So, we ask: can the LongForm (LF) format, which allows the presentation of dense and extensive content, be a viable alternative to MC, when applied to complex educational content, specific to undergraduate courses? The LF, hypothetically, can offer better support for higher distance education courses. To answer the question, an educational activity, elaborated in both formats, was applied to 67 students from a university of Minas Gerais state, in Brazil. The observation of student activity revealed their preferences: MC has shown to be good for building learning with smaller materials in both size and content complexity, but LF was more appropriated when dealing with complex, dense, multimedia-requiring contents to facilitate understanding. It was confirmed that the LF presents itself as a viable alternative for online studying because it is constituted by a single virtual space where larger texts and varied multimedia resources can be inserted to enrich the educational material and to offer the full content for students. © 2021 Universidad de Murcia.

The paper presents the instructional theory developed through two implementations and discusses how this instructional theory may enrich learning regardless of the constraints during the COVID19 pandemic, in which small-group meetings are possible but large-class meetings are moved online. Although, in theory, wikis should be a powerful technology to support collaborative learning, empirical research reveals challenges regarding student motivation, group dynamics, and assessment. To bridge the gaps between theory and practice, we used the design-based research approach (DBR) and collaborated with two expert practitioners to develop the instructional theory. The research process includes an initial theory, implementations in two cases, and theory refinement. Data collection and analysis involve literature review, multiple individual interviews with experts before and during implementations, weekly class observations, focus-group interviews with students during implementation, content analysis of class wikis, and focus-group interviews with experts for theory refinement. The results of the study presented in this paper focus on the refined instructional theory, which was grounded in theoretical work, expert instructors' heuristic knowledge, and local effectiveness. In addition, this paper includes design principles with some considerations to support learning in COVID19 environments. In other words, the success of using wikis to foster a culture of sharing, and to increase student motivation and participation in individual or group project work, as well as in community knowledge building for an entire class, may enrich learning during the pandemic by creating learner-centered, knowledge-centered, assessment-centered, and community-centered learning environments. © 2021 Universidad de Murcia.

An educational response to this social demand is digital competence. Thus, this purpose requires optimal levels of Digital Teaching Competence (DTC), especially in the Vocational Education Training (VET) sector. With the aim of attending to this educational context, this work proposes a understanding framework that integrates the vision of pedagogy, resources and evaluation to understand, evaluate and propose improvements in the digital competence of VET teachers. Using a qualitative approach, eleven in-depth interviews were conducted on the DTC of VET teachers from seven schools in the province of Valencia (Spain). These data were analysed from the categorization of four educational scenarios with technology (individual learning, teaching with ICT, collaborative learning and student self-learning). The main conclusion detected is that interviewed teachers have knowledge of some technological resources and applications, attitude and ability to incorporate them into their teaching practice. However, they do not integrate technology in the learning assessment at the same competence level as in the other dimensions. © 2021 Universidad de Murcia.

The results of this study indicate that Colombian Higher Education Institutions are implementing teaching-learning models that are modified according to the contingencies of the context and the ways of conceiving the different roles played by the actors participating in the educational process. In particular, it was found that these institutions define educational models in which asynchronous interaction prevails, evaluate through parameterized activities in the virtual campus, and train their teachers to improve their competencies in the design of virtual learning scenarios. In practical terms, this study suggests that the methodological characteristics of virtual education at an undergraduate and graduate level differ from face-to-face education, so institutions should approach both modalities with different pedagogical strategies. © 2021 Universidad de Murcia.

Based on the analysis of the results of an online survey answered in March 2020 by more than 35.000 families with children between the ages of 3 and 18, this article explores the consequences of the digital divide on the learning opportunities of students during confinement. The analysis highlights the interaction with other educational -different school responses- and social aspects - different possibilities of study support- to explain the different distance learning opportunities for students. The digital divide, in its various forms, the confinement conditions or the unequal family cultural capital generated unequal learning opportunities among students. The conclusions of the article point out the lessons learned from this experience to ensure equal educational opportunities in non-face-to-face educational contexts. © 2023 Universidad de Murcia.

Thus, the general aim of the study is to explore the academic beliefs of Spanish Language and Literature teachers about the didactic development of argumentation in text commentary in the current context of multimodal and hypertextual reception. A qualitative methodology of interpretative-phenomenological design has been followed. Thirty-three teachers of Spanish Language and Literature, specifically selected as key informants for their teaching profile and professional experience, participated in the study. Regarding the instrument, a semi-structured interview was designed, through which data were collected and analyzed by means of the qualitative software Atlas.ti (version 7).

We were thinking of the metaverse, with the technology that it presents or with hypothetical new platforms that are emerging. The perspective was to improve and expand pedagogical possibilities in specific aspects, where it was more difficult to improve. This is the case with those offered by traditional symbolic systems, whose advantages are obvious and refined by tradition and culture: those related to learning and acquisition of reading and writing, learning and acquisition of abilities to produce computer codes (computational thinking) and, finally, those related to learning and acquisition of mathematical symbolic writing. We briefly analyzed the problems and vicissitudes to deal with the novelty of the approach and possible doubts about the validity of the call for papers. It can be said that, although the monograph has brought together ten works of sufficient quality, most of the objectives set forth have not been achieved. Of the papers published here, four are exclusively about the metaverse. A very interesting one gives us an idea, after some conditions that guarantee its reliability, about the state of what is being done with metaverse in classroom practice in the design and implementation phases. Finally, there has been an aspect in which the objective has not been achieved at all, and this could cause us to reflect on some proposals made in terms of metaverse speculation. There was no contribution among the accepted papers or the many rejected manuscripts on the metaverse as a new code capable of supporting the communication and representation of thought or similar similar to how key codes, the basis of communication and learning, do so: alphabetic writing, writing through numerical codes and program codes, computational thinking. © 2023 Universidad de Murcia.

Its instructional design focus is the activation principle. In this article, the authors present the current issue, describe the activation principle as an important theoretical foundation of instructional design for computational thinking and mathematics and STEM Education, and introduce subsequent papers. There are numerous skills and concepts, specific to Computational Thinking, Mathematics and STEM, that are necessary as a basis for undergraduate studies. Often these concepts and procedures do not appear explicitly in the primary and secondary school curriuclum. Or, if they do appear, there is no guarantee students will have mastered them by graduation. We cannot expect these skills to appear spontaneously, at the very moment they are needed. A solid cognitive foundation is necessary for them to be activated. This special issue is presented with the aim of disseminating investigations and cases that partially or totally engage with these ideas. This can aid investigation of whether the effective use of the activation principle (Merrill, 2002; revised edition 2020), when used in an adequate instructional design, with methods, activites and resources, contributes to an improvement in the quality of learning results when what is learned in the previous stages is activated and reactivated sufficiently in undergraduate studies, and whether a pedagogy that establishes the value of these ideas and principles from the earliest educational stages should be promoted in order to prepare students for learning on the horizon, including STEM. © 2021 Universidad de Murcia.

Due to the pandemic, teachers and students have changed their way of teaching and learning. METHOD. To see if the competence in school mathematics in future teachers has varied before and after the confinement by Covid-19, a sample of four groups of students has been taken, two from the 2019/20 academic year, and another two from the 2021/22 academic year, belonging to the bilingual group and to a normal group who passed the sixth grade test to assess mathematical competence. RESULTS. The results indicate a considerable decrease in this two-year period in mathematical competence in Numbers, Measurement, Geometry and Uncertainty, and also in the three cognitive processes, the lowest being Knowing and reproducing. CONCLUSIONS. The quarantine period, the methodology based on videoconferences with synchronous expository methods in the students' schedule in the face-to-face modality and the evaluation through online tests as established in the University's contingency plan, have been able to contribute to the decrease in the mathematical competence of future teachers. © 2022 Universidad de Murcia.

We conducted a qualitative content analysis, using the definitions provided by a selection of outstanding authors and institutions as primary materials. Three aspects were analyzed: Definition, features and elements, and scope of knowledge. We have found two common components in the definitions analyzed: The reference to a ""mental activity"" and the inclusion of programming skills. However, they differ in the inclusion of other elements, which can be classified as knowledge, attitudes or competences. The article discusses the consequences of a definition based on a ""mental activity"" rather than educational constructs.

This policy contributes to a model that, beyond the isolated-subject curricula of university degrees, connects topics, disciplines, professionals and context needs through a policy that fosters and increases the social capital of the institution. Through a diagnosis of internal and external connections, an action plan is designed. This is regulated by the principle of the universities’ social responsibility and establishes a short-, mid- and long-term action plan in relation to the internal and external dimension of our degree studies. This strategy is monitored through the Networks and Partnerships Unit. This Unit supervises, supports and centralizes; different projects and actions, among which there are interdisciplinary inter-studies challenges, S-L within the territory and the development of a Magnet Project, among others.

In this context, the joint, collective, collaborative and community work of the different agents with educational responsibilities is critical. Higher education,; widely recognized for its educational value, often fails to interact with other socioeducational and community-based agents in the construction and care of the ecosystem, and its model is still characterized by its tendency to be centripetal and bureaucratic. In this sense, the importance of greater flexibility, openness, and connection with society is emphasized, from a conception of universities open to the entire population. The 3rd World Higher Education Conference (WHEC2022), organized and promoted by UNESCO, pointed out the need to create more open, inclusive, equitable, and collaborative higher learning systems to address the challenges of our time. The university's ability to forge alliances in support of the Sustainable Development Goals is key to achieving this major challenge from a perspective of quality education for everyone.

Based on the digital literacy framework by Martin and Grudziecki (2006), a study was developed aiming to identify university students' digital competences, as well as the uses and effects of digital literacy in the development of personal and social skills. Data collection, using an online questionnaire, took place during the initial closing period of HEIs in Portugal. The results point to an almost widespread mastery of search and data editing skills and to a lesser ability to create and develop new digital solutions. Most students reported that digital technologies were used (before the crisis)] mainly for institutional communication and between peers, but not for the development of networking and lifelong learning skills. The lack of involvement of many teachers in the available pedagogical support is an obstacle to an adequate digital transformation in higher education, both in times of crisis and in the future. © 2021 Universidad de Murcia.

The method was intrinsic to a single case with a sequential study design based on quantitative methods. Two instruments were applied to 176 university students, the first to measure the acceptance of the virtual environment and the second to assess the development of complex reasoning. The results indicate that the evaluation of the virtual campus and its tools is satisfactory, with very favorable evaluations in terms of ease and intention of use, likewise, the 3D learning experience allowed to scale mainly scientific and critical thinking skills.

However, there is a lack of data in current academic research on the assessment and integration of this competence in teacher training with current educational technology. Thus, this project had a dual purpose: On the one hand, it aimed to examine the global competence of different groups of student teachers through the development of Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) following a content and language integrated learning (CLIL) approach. On the other, researchers aimed to determine optimal methods for the improvement and integration of this necessary competence in the curriculum. The project was developed with the collaboration of pre-service and in-service teachers enrolled in various master's programs at two European universities in Spain and Belgium. The research was carried out following a pre-test / post-test type design with various assessment instruments based on the OECD (2018) global competence framework. The quantitative analyses showed that, by integrating the SDGs when teaching contents, the participants improved in various domains of Global Competence (adaptability, openness to diversity, perspective taking), but also decreased in other areas (ability to interact in a multicultural world, respect for other cultures, ability to adopt another culture). The qualitative research showed that among the main educational technology examined, telecollaboration can optimise at least five dimensions of Global Competence. Despite the small size of the sample and the complexity of evaluating this competence, this study contributes to educational innovation by presenting didactic telecollaborative proposals and a theoretical framework for the integration and appraisal of Global Competence in (future) educators. © 2022 Universidad de Murcia.

In this research, we rely on educational regulation as a necessary mechanism for self-directed learning processes in MOOCs. The purpose is to analyse a process of metacognitive enrichment of the design of a MOOC, with the contribution of the learners themselves. We implement a design-based research model, where self-regulation is, at the same time, the object of study and purpose of the design, which is used to personalize and make learning more flexible in an open massive environment. We develop a tool for the profiling of learners in their self-direction of learning in relation to three competency axes: motivational, social and reflective. The learners themselves participate in the development of this tool through a series of co-design workshops. The article presents the results of the process of design and implementation of the tool (or learner profile test): on the one hand, it presents the qualitative analysis of the contributions to the workshops for the construction of the tool and, on the other, the results after its implementation in the MOOC. The main contributions have to do, on the one hand, with the design solutions provided to support regulated learning and ML in MOOCs. On the other hand, they show the need to take care of the motivational components in the design of MOOCs, as well as the introduction of metacognitive aids that activate the self-monitoring strategies of the participants and progressively improve their self-perception and the alignment of their attitude with their activity in the MOOC, especially regarding the social learning dimension. © 2022 Universidad de Murcia.

The results show that the students' attention was attracted to the elements that make up the IVR environment. Likewise, a good acceptance of the IVR device and satisfactory interactions have been observed. In conclusion, it can be stated that the IVR environment has provided realism and remarkable possibilities for interaction. © 2023 Universidad de Murcia.

The models are analyzed using the IARCO model and a transmodalizing proposal of genre is made, consisting of the transformation of argumentative reflection in text commentary. Secondly, a case study report is made based on the contrastive analysis of four texts produced by students of the selected programs. The results show improved indicators of complex thinking; in particular, the crossing of the multimodality variant with that of creative thinking is relevant. The article discusses how the proposal makes it possible to relate theory with practice prior to practicing the teaching profession, and it is concluded that including multimodal argumentation in teacher training may be one more way to solve the disconnection between theory and practice in programs with courses taught without classroom intervention. © 2023 Universidad de Murcia.

Dewey recognized the role of interest as a powerful tool to engage learners. Yet, despite contemporary efforts to study the phenomenon, few learning designs recognize this potential. The current paper presents a conceptual framework for integrating popular culture into STEM, using computational thinking competencies as both a critical mechanism and context for application and testing. Interest contributes to motivation through self-regulation, and self-regulation has the power to enhance the cycle of learning achievement and interest. Through this framework, Merrill's Activation Principle provides guidance on why and how we should attend to this cycle. By evoking positive memories related to learner interests, we can enhance other stages of learning disconnected from the initial learning experience. STEM educators and scholars can use this framework and confidently design and evaluate learning activities targeting computational thinking development using popular media and culture. © 2021 Universidad de Murcia.

This quasi-experimental work used a group defined as an experimental group that participated in a workshop on the intersection of polyhedrons and the intersection of surfaces of revolution using VR as a means to interact with the intercepted solids, while a second group, the control group, developed the same topics with two-dimensional images of the intercepted solids. The evaluation instrument measured the dimensions of mental rotation and mental folding, this was applied to both groups at the beginning and at the end of the workshop, managing to measure their SA for the rigid and non-rigid transformation of objects.

If the educational influence exercised by the teacher or other practitioners is to be effective, it must be contingent and adapted to the learning process as it evolves. The concept of distributed educational influence reflects the idea that in collaborative learning settings the exercise of educational influence is distributed among all participants, since all can and should contribute through their actions to the achievement of effective collaboration that promotes the communicative, social and cognitive processes involved in learning. In this paper we present a theoretical and methodological model for analysing collaborative learning processes in digital environments based on the concepts of educational influence and distributed educational influence.

The educational benefit of semiosis is studied by which human intelligence makes arguments to construct hypothetical knowledge of action research and the assistance that artificial intelligence reports to its cognitive scaffolding with its computational technologies. This is consistent with the necessary consideration of teachers as apprentices of their own work through professional development projects in real contexts to promote social improvement from the empowerment of the educational community through a vision of distributed leadership.

The goal of this paper is to find out how the competency evaluation in a university is carried out, starting from the notion of competence and the tools of a Learning Management System that have been successfully used to carry out this process. Subsequently, we describe the preliminary results of a diagnosis applied to teachers of the Autonomous University of Yucatan. The results corroborate that there are few tools that are used more frequently and that there is a general lack of knowledge about the potential benefits that these have for the evaluation of generic competences.

Those, who have been enthusiastic at the beginning are now more esceptical about the future development of teaching with digital media, others maintain their positive attitude and look for ways to promote and implement their use in the university. Less discussed are the economic implications that digitization may have on the universities stakeholders and their decision making. In the field of online and distance education a descriptive approach of the costs and benefits has been so far predominant. We will raise instead some points to initiate a discussion about the economics of digital educational ressources and the possibile reaction and impact of teachers, students and institutions. We will point out also some long-term perspectives that digitalization of education might have on a global level. Concluding we will argue that digitilization of educational content and the respective applications followed a continuous development pushed especially by universities of distance education and that phenomena such as MOOCs are not as ""disruptive"" as some claim. Instead, national policies, economic sustainability and the impact of digitization on different stakeholders will determine the future form of the ""Digital University"" in case such a university exists. © 2018 Revista de Educacion a Distancia.

This article shows the results of a research conducted in four primary schools from Valencia and Galicia that are recognized because of their innovative trajectory in the use of ICTs. The aim is to identify and analyse the visions of the education community members from each school about the digital competence which is being acquired by the students involved in educational practices mediated by ICTs. To collect the information, it was used a qualitative method based on interviews with teachers, families and students. The results reflect different work models and concepts about the digital competence. It is recognized that the ICTs are relevant to the inclusion in the society of tomorrow and it has been demystified their hegemonic role on school learning. © 2019 Universidad de Murcia.

However, we have not found enough research that examined the pedagogical practice in virtual and multicultural contexts. In this work, we aim to identify the characteristics of the online discourse; analyze their relationship with the teachers´ practice online and identify how the virtual environment impacts on the teachers´ practices from a multicultural perspective. This qualitative study entailed horizontal and vertical analyses of the discussion process, utilizing the micro-textual method. The findings suggest that the online environment is a fertile arena for creating an academic and multicultural learning context. In the course of the study, four types of discourse were identified: personal-autobiographical, disciplinary, professional, and ethno-cultural; as well as three teaching approaches: the personal-empathic, the academic and the professional. The work invites to rethink ways of teacher training in virtual environments, holding that this environment challenges its practice, generating a need for an approach that exceeds the digital dimension, and is installed in the multicultural practice. © 2018 Revista de Educacion a Distancia.

We argue that the introduction of AI contents at schools through practical, hands-on, projects is the way to go to educate conscientious and critical citizens of the future, to awaken vocations among youth people, as well as to foster students' computational thinking skills. However, most existing programming platforms for education lack some of the required educational features to develop a complete understanding of AI. In this paper we present LearningML, a new platform aimed at learning supervised Machine Learning (ML), one of the most successful AI techniques that is in the basis of almost every current AI application. This work describes the main functionalities of the tool and discusses some decisions taken during its design. For its conception, we have taken into account lessons learned from the research literature on introducing AI in school and from the analysis of other educational tools built with the aim to allow learners to use ML. We offer as well some promising results obtained after a preliminary testing pilot workshop. Finally, the next steps in the development of LearningML are presented, focused on the face and instructional validation of the tool. © 2020 Universidad de Murcia.

The need to assemble tutoring methods supported with popular technology is not new, but rather an added issue over preceding pitfalls with technologies like Internet or social networks. In this context, cyberbullying represents one of the main reasons for this discrepancy where teachers and educational directors struggle to harmonize the use of mobile devices in schools. This manuscript explores from the perspective of 135 teachers (M=32) how mobiles are used for learning, their inclination with regard to use own devices and social networks for tutoring students, threats and opportunities of mobile devices, which regulation they know with regard to the use of mobile devices in schools, and the age they consider suitable for children to own a smartphone. The results not only provide evidence of the risks in immature-delivery of smartphone to a child/adolescent, but also show lessons learned to facilitate tutoring supported with mobile technology.

Goya has not lost validity, and like the rest of culture, he lives not just by the painting, the books and other analogic formats; he is a habitant from the virtual world which is increasingly more real. In the first place, this paper approaches some principles of the hypertextual narrative applied to Francisco de Goya y Lucientes though the construction of a narration which is able to be broken in blocks linked to external (web) and internal texts, providing thousands of narrative possibilities to access to the Goya's world and paintings, and developing a multinarration. In the second place, starting from the multinarration, we make the classification of a sample made by 14 paintings from Goya, in this categories: Painting for professional activity, Painting as historical testimony, Painting for pleasure, and Painture by need.

In general, the flipped learning model proposes that the direct instruction is replaced by learning materials, which are delivered outside the class while typical homework activities are implemented in class time. On this basis, a flipped classroom experience was carried out in the “Reading comprehension in English as a foreign language” class in the fifth semester of a public high school in the city of Xalapa, Veracruz (Mexico). Digital resources and multimedia activities were developed and hosted in a Moodle platform.

Consequently, the CoI model identifies the presence of three dimensions: a) the cognitive presence, referred to the degree to which the participants are capable of constructing meaning and knowledge through continuous communication, reflection and discussion; b) the social presence, defined as the ability of participants to identify with the community, communicate and develop interpersonal relationships; c) the teaching presence, referred to the design, guidance and direction, on the part of the faculty, of cognitive and social processes with the purpose of achieving significant learning results in the students. The validation of the survey in the context of Spanish distance learning shows satisfactory results from the point of view of construct validity and reliability as internal consistency, ( > 0.90 for each dimension), confirming the usefulness and interest of this instrument in investigations that seek to analyze and improve the development of educational processes through communities of inquiry. © 2019 Universidad de Murcia.

In education, access and massification of digital infrastructure has led to the need to conceptualize and reconceptualize the term digital literacy from various angles as a way of understanding what are the skills needed to participate in a hyperconnected world. In this work, a systematic review of the bibliography related to the topic was carried out using the Scopus database. A diachronic study was carried out that examined 138 articles obtained from the terms digital literacy, education and school. An early conceptualization based on the need to incorporate skills to use technologies instrumentally was identified, and a contemporary reconceptualization in which the idea that mastering hardware and software is enough to consider a person digitally literate is overcome. It is concluded that, in order to make digital literacy conceptualizations, terms such as information literacy, computer literacy and media literacy must necessarily be considered, since new literacies based on the incorporation of technologies in education are articulated on these parameters. © 2021 Universidad de Murcia.

Yet almost three decades later, there is still little research to describe the K-12 online learning student experience, which has resulted in a lack of understanding of the actual instructional model, nature of the curriculum, and type and amount of support employed by K-12 online learning programs. Further, much of the available research is atheoretical, methodologically questionable, contextually limited, and overgeneralized. All these factors make the K-12 online learning research that does exist of little value in guiding practice.

In any event, the incorporation of this kind of technology is demanding the implementation of organizational structures capable of adapting to the inherent potentialities of mobile devices, as well as to the different conceptual approaches in the teaching-learning process. In this work we propose a model of structure for the Visual Arts Education, which integrates the different phases and the necessary actions to be carried out, while considering learners as the central axis of the process. This model is based, on the one hand, on the definition of the learning setting, the strategic planning and the operational phase, and on the other hand, on the contexts and the working spaces from where the forms of intervention in the Visual Arts Education may be organised. As a final result, the instructional design of the mobile devices determines the planning of the actions in spaces of autonomous and authentic learning in which Visual Arts Education takes place. Finally, we propose the definition of the prototype, the test, the evaluation and the implementation of the strategy at the moment of production. © 2019 Universidad de Murcia.

However, once ubiquitous learning evolves into an educational concept, its contributions may become more relevant and pertinent in the context of ubiquity and its applications in learning. For this reason, the objective of this work was to carry out a documentary review on the term ubiquitous learning, to make a critical analysis that supports its development. The Conceptual Cartography method was used, through a four-phase procedure: 1) Search for documents relevant to the research; 2) Definition of inclusion and exclusion criteria for documents; 3) Data analysis with analytical categories (Notion, Characterization, Categorization, Differentiation, Classification, Exemplification and Linkage); 4) Interpretation of results. The main result suggests that ubiquitous learning matured conceptually, due to the incorporation of two approaches: continuous and personalized learning. However, these approaches are based on learning ideals, so it is necessary to specify concepts that support the ubiquitous learning perspective when establishing concrete educational practices. © 2021 Universidad de Murcia.

The results show that most of them are case studies. Technological studies, bound to the design and establishment of augmented reality resources in the clinical setting, are the ones that stand out. Furthermore, those associated to interventions in the educational environment incorporate augmented reality as a teaching resource in the school setting. Finally, those developed in a psycho-experimental context describe interventions with augmented reality and analyse the people's behaviour in different fields. Unanimity is observed when it comes to highlight the positive impact these apps or augmented reality systems have to stimulate social interaction. However, interventions phases are not specified nor are accessible or commercial resources used, what restricts its extrapolation to other contexts.

One of the limitations of e-learning systems is the difficulty to observe and correct the learning process individually. Generally, variation of individual course content is based on binary decision: whether the test has been passed or not. The particular characteristics of the students are not taken into account by the systems, although pedagogical theory achieved sufficient results. The authors consider the possibility of immersing Lev Vygotsky's theory of socio-constructivism into a digital environment, particularly its focus on the continuous change of personal development zones. Since currently do not exist quantitative models of developmental zones, the task is posed and solved to construct a mathematical model of the proximal developmental zone, based on the item response theory and computational psychometrics. To quantitatively estimate the width of the zone of proximal development, we use the idea of its proportionality to the knowledge level, which, in turn, is considered as a latent variable. For a formal description of the knowledge level, we propose a list of measurable indicators: indicators of educational activity and the pattern of interaction between the user and the digital environment. The constructed model of the development zone is used for the adaptive management of e-learning, in which it presents a control algorithm that implements cognitive development. The technique of assessing the suitability of applying the model of the proximal development zone is described. To assess feasibility, the experimental material has been used: data on the results of educational activities of 1469 students in two countries: Russia and Ecuador. As a result of the study, the hypothesis was confirmed that the level of training achieved in the course with the elements of cognitive development is higher than the results of e-learning, without taking into account the theory of socio-constructivism. In addition, approaches to the architecture of the modern digital educational environment are considered. © 2020 Universidad de Murcia.

This study may be of interest to those who wish to offer flexible learning environments to adults who require to pursue advanced training in institutions where they believe in technology-based socio-constructivism and where not necessarily there is a single educational and operational model to offer learning opportunities. Keeping the essence of the seminar methodology that guides the MPTIC and the multi-dimensionality that assumes the hybrid learning modality in this master's degree program, it was conducted the redesign and testing of the second level of a seminar offered to one of the cohorts of the MPTIC. In this process the actors were the same as in the first level-the same students participated, were guided by the same faculty members, and were accompanied by the same managers, but the operational model of the second level of the course of interest was adjusted to overcome some of the limitations found out in the implementation of the first level course. This had the intention of seeking more active participation at individual and group level, as well as to achieve better qualitative results in the application of what has been learned to the teaching environments in which the participants of the MPTIC do their deepening projects. This study sought to determine what lessons this pedagogical transformation leaves, in the face of its possible replication in other courses of the MPTIC and / or in contexts and by other actors of advanced training programs at the service of people who work and study, and who require making use of flexible learning environments.

New pedagogies, which incorporate both informal and formal learning and support personalization of learning, are central to this objective. Educators are required to reassess the use of traditional pedagogies, as they attempt to foster development of skills and competencies for lifelong learning. Heutagogy, or self-determined learning, is a learning theory that addresses this need, giving students agency in determining what and how they learn. The theory is based in the principles of learner agency, capability and self-efficacy, reflection and metacognition, and non-linear learning, and when used with technology can be a powerful instructional approach for building students’ self-directed and lifelong learning skills. A compelling example of this is the e-portfolio. As a platform and assessment tool, the e-portfolio spans the spectrum of lifelong learning, as well as encompasses both formal and informal learning of the individual learner and addresses critical aspects of learning and reflection, showcasing the learner’s acquired skills and competencies. Based on successful cases in the literature, this article discusses the principles of heutagogy, the pedagogy-andragogy-heutagogy (PAH continuum) and its application in online learning environments, and the use of the e-portfolio in further cultivating and advancing self-determined learning. The article also offers recommendations for future practice and theory. © 2020 Universidad de Murcia.

Firstly, they do not explicitly start from a model of teaching action, and implicitly reduce the teaching function to the classroom performance, avoiding aspects such as social and political commitment, or the role of the school in community development. Secondly, they are based on a taxonomic vision of the concept of competence, ignoring the complexity of the different contexts in which competence is carried on and developed, as well as its role in the construction of teacher identity, something that socio-material and holistic approaches do include. Thirdly, they are based on an instrumentalist vision of technology as a neutral tool in values and, on the contrary, on a deterministic conception of the relationship between technology and society.

The sample was made up of university students from the Faculty of Education Sciences of the University of Granada (n = 385), aged between 18 and 46 (M = 24.08; DT = 5.00). A quantitative methodology was used applying two internationally standardized scales. The study findings confirmed a medium-high degree in smartphone addiction, the influence of usage time on smartphone addiction and age and academic degree as factors influencing self-esteem. On the other hand, the structural equation model showed a negative correlation between smartphone addiction and self-esteem.

Experiences have been developed in collaboration with educational institutions and ministries of education in two Latin American countries. The educational technologies used are virtual learning environments (VLE), synchronous collaboration systems, and Scratch / Snap online programming environments. The educational methodologies developed are based on collaborative work teachers-tutors, teachers-students, and students-students.

Those, who were enthusiastic at the beginning are now more sceptical about the future development of teaching with digital media, others maintain their positive attitude and are looking for ways to promote and implement their use in universities. Numerous institutions have published or are publishing forecasts and time frames about the relevance of the upcoming innovations. Less discussed are the economic implications that digitization may have on the universities'stakeholders and their decision making. In the field of online and distance education a descriptive approach of the costs and benefits has been so far predominant. Instead we will raise some points to initiate a discussion about the economics of digital educational resources and the possible reactions of and impact on teachers, students and institutions. We will also point out some of the long-term effects that digitalization of education might have on a global level. Concluding that digitization followed a continuous development pulsed especially by universities of distance education and that phenomena such as MOOCs are not as ""disruptive"" as some claim. Instead, national policies, economic sustainability and the impact of digitization on different stakeholders will determine the future form of the ""Digital University"" in case such a university exists. © 2018 Revista de Educacion a Distancia.

The study has involved 257 students and has been carried out following a qualitative methodology, using interviews, a research diary and the application called Mentimeter as data gathering tools. The results indicate that this methodology facilitates motivation, autonomy and commitment with learning. Furthermore, it serves to develop participation and commitment to the professional community and the citizenship. Also, regarding the learning-teaching processes, the results show an increase of autonomy, of the prior knowledge necessary to solve assignments and of formative assessment.

We also resort to research and authors that help us understand what these challenges are, where they come from, who poses them and what meanings emerge for the teaching profession.

For EI exercised by the teacher or other actors to be effective, it must be contingent and adjusted to the development and evolution of the learning process. The concept of distributed educational influence (DEI) reflects the idea that in collaborative learning settings the exercise of EI is distributed among all participants, since all can and should contribute with their actions to achieve an effective collaboration that promotes the communicative, social and cognitive processes involved in learning.
